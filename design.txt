for each path, a folder and a page.tsx must be created
when data changes, an action must be created (eg. new-package.ts)
when there are pages to revalidate, the action must do that

users:
admin: xyz@libero.it
customer: abc@gmail.com

- bug with english version of entries list
- deployment with github actions
- custom login form for i18n (see gemini)
- replace react-gauge-componentn with recharts (which is compatible with react19)
- replace deprecated @nextui.org packages with @heroui
- find some data grid components to edit stuff
- favicon
- profile page
